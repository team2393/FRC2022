/** Simple robot that tests ball handling
 * 
 *  In teleop:
 *  * Nothing should happen
 *  * Check dashboard for "Ball in Conveyor", "Ball in Feeder"
 *    and "Ball Ejected" sensors.
 *    Do they indicate a "Ball" when something is placed at each
 *    location?
 *  * Push A to toggle loading 'on':
 *    Intake should move out/open.
 *    Intake and conveyor should turn on.
 *    Verify that intake (two motors) and conveyor move "in".
 *    Do intake and conveyor motors get up to speed or do
 *    we need to extend the state machine to separate opening/closing
 *    intake from running the motors (like 2016 robot)?
 *  * Push A to toggle loading 'off':
 *    Intake should move in
 *    Intake and conveyor should turn off
 *  * Push A to toggle loading back 'on':
 *    Intake should move out/open
 *    Intake and conveyor should turn on
 *  * Feed one ball, should get pulled in, intake and conveyor keep running
 *  * Feed second ball, intake and conveyor should stop
 *  * Push A to toggle loading 'on/off',
 *    intake should open/close but intake motor and conveyor stay off
 *    when there are already two balls
 * 
 *    TODO Later add check of ball color and reject wrong colored ball?
 * 
 *  * On Dashboard, check if "High" allows moving the shooter angle solenoid
 *    to the high (true) and low (false) setup.
 * 
 *  * Push 'X' to toggle spinner on/off
 *    Spinner should turn on/off
 * 
 *  * Push left bumper to shoot
 *    Spinner should turn on in case it wasn't already running.
 *    Wait until spinner fast enough (95% of desired speed. Is 95% a good number?)
 *    Feeder moves ball up to spinner.
 *    Feeder stops one ball has been ejected.
 *    Spinner either remains on for just 2 seconds
 *    or until 'spinner always on' toggled to off via 'X'
 *
 *  * Try shooting without balls loaded:
 *    Spinner should run up,
 *    feeder runs up,
 *    shot times out after 10 seconds.
